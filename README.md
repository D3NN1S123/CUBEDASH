Cube Dash Video Game

This is a beginner video game I programmed in C#, using the Unity Engine. Since this is the first time I've been introduced to video game development, I've been using Brackey's Youtube Series to learn the basics, and then used my own knowledge to build onto this, and add my own features to the game.
